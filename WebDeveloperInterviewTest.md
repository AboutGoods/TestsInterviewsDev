## 🗓 Allowed time
- 2 Weeks *max* since you receive the mail (you can send your work  before)

## 📌 The needs - Company phone repository
:::warning
This is a fictional test to measure your skills. 😉
:::

In order to improve the company's information system you must create a company repository (a phone book).

The company wants to operate a simple REST API in order to manage people with their phone number inside and outside the company. The REST API will help connect the phone book with the current information system.

### ✈️ Needs
- Add a User with necessary informations (Phone, First Name and Last Name)
- Get the list of all user in the repository
- Update or Remove a given user by its identifier

### ❗️ Constraints

- You will use [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) as main programming language
- **You don't need any database**, your API will store data in-memory (a collection of users)
- You need to use the [Ktor framework](https://ktor.io/) to handle this problem as it is easy to use and perfect for this use case
- **No authentication system is required**, make it simple as possible

## ❇️ Result expected
- A fully working API that we can launch and test with the included `.http` file. 
    - [🌍Learn more about this file here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/http-client-in-product-code-editor.html)

### 📁 Files expected

- Source code hosted on a public versionning hub (Github, Gitlab, etc.) with public access
- A Readme in Markdown format that explain how to launch your project and what were the difficulties you faced during the development
- A markdown explaning which design patterns you used, which framework and libraries you used and **why**.

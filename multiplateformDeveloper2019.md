# Multiplateform developer exercise

## Allowed time
- 1 Week *max* since you receive the mail (you can send your work  before)

## The Rick and Morty universe
We need to create a **front interface** for the Rick & Morty universe, to allow fans to navigate through elements and character of the TV Show.

We specially need to :
- Browse all the `locations` of all differents `universes` in a list
- Search for a specific `location` by it's `type` 
- When clicking on a `location`, showing details and image of the planet and a list of all the `residents` 
- We want to show details (including picture) of a resident by clicking on it
- We also want to create a new location or resident locally
- We want a favorite system to save our favorite `resident` and `location` with a way to filter them by their type.

## Resources 
In this test you will use the following API as back-end for getting resources

### [http://rickandmortyapi.com](http://rickandmortyapi.com)

## Result expected
- A fully working front application 

### Files expected
- Source code hosted on a public versionning hub (Github, Gitlab, etc.)
- A Readme in Markdown format that explain how to launch your project and what were the difficulties you faced during the development

## ðŸŒŸ Help
- You are free to choose the technology you want in this list : 
  - Mobile application (Android or iOS, you can use hybrid frameworks as long as it's not Xamarin)
  - Web application (using a front web framework like VueJS, React or others)
- If you opt for web application we expect you to store favorites and new data into a **dedicated back-end** (PHP Back end, NodeJS, Go, etc.) with a DBMS (Any kind, NoSQL, SQL, Graph, etc.)
- If you prefer to do a mobile native application we expect you to use the **dedicated database management** system included with the SDK of the OS.
- This exercise is rather simple, so we expect you to follow the **best practices** in the language / framework you choose.
- A nice and responsive UI is a big + for us
- You are free to **implement more from the API**

## Final touch
Document yourself long before coding and try to do what you can. If you can't predict but you have something that should work, send us your code with explanations anyway.

This test is not eliminatory, it allows us to see how you handle this kind of projects.
